## Source-of-truth hierarchy

1. Agent Core Postgres `factory.*` — operational status, tasks, gates, runs, events, alerts.
2. Repo artifacts — methodology documents and evidence, indexed from this file.
3. Git commits — historical checkpoint that preserves the project record.
4. Notion/dashboard — human PM/reporting projection.
5. Chat/tool output — execution transcript and live verification.

## Builder reading order

1. `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
2. `PROJECT_GLOBAL_VISION.md`
3. `FACTORY_RUNTIME_CONTRACT_V1.md`
4. `PRD.md`
5. `ADRS.md`
6. `TECHNICAL_BLUEPRINT.md`
7. `SPRINT_PLAN.md`
8. `TASK_GRAPH.md`
9. Task-specific prompt/acceptance criteria from Factory DB

## Correction note

The first closure attempt used Notion/docs waivers. That was not canonical. The current correction adds runtime checks so future Factory projects cannot silently skip documentation indexing or commit checkpoints.
