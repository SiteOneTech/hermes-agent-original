# Notion Update — Factory Runtime Evolution

## Final status

The project-specific Notion PM page exists and was verified during R0 reconciliation.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Project ID | `factory-runtime-evolution` |
| Factory DB status | `completed` |
| Reconcile result | `anomalies=[]`, `pending_gates=0`, `active_runs=0` |
| Notion page | `Factory Runtime Evolution — Factory PM` |
| Notion page ID | `37737b39-cad6-8198-a63e-faf0920031d4` |
| Notion URL | `https://app.notion.com/p/Factory-Runtime-Remediation-Factory-PM-37737b39cad68198a63efaf0920031d4` |

## Evidence

- Factory DB metadata includes `notion_tracker_page_id` and `notion_tracker_url`.
- Notion API verified the page exists, is not archived, and is not in trash.
- R0 task `factory-runtime-evolution-reconcile-missing-notion-project` closed as `done`.
- Final gates after the repo-first commit checkpoint:
  - `critical_readiness` passed, gate_id `261`.
  - `delivery` passed, gate_id `262`.

## Canonical interpretation

The earlier `delivery_hold` note was an intermediate runtime-approval blocker, not final state. The final source-of-truth state is:

1. Factory DB: completed.
2. Repo artifacts: indexed and committed.
3. Notion: linked as human PM/reporting projection.
4. Git checkpoint: committed in the repo-first remediation worktree, then code enforcement carried into the main working branch.

Factory DB and repo artifacts remain canonical. Notion is only the human-readable PM layer.
