# G0 Repository Strategy

| Field | Decision |
|---|---|
| `repo_scope` | `zeus_only` |
| `work_intent` | `add_functionality` |
| `primary_repo` | `SiteOneTech/hermes-agent-original` |
| `primary_repo_remote` | `https://github.com/SiteOneTech/hermes-agent-original.git` (`origin`) |
| `primary_repo_path` | `/home/jean/Projects/hermes-agent-original` |
| `successor_project_path` | `factory/projects/zeus-alpha-research-ledger-core/` |
| `predecessor_project_id` | `zeus-independent-alpha-research` (documentation-only predecessor; no runtime module delivered) |
| `base_branch` | `origin/main`; fetched during ALR-010 local verification at `2026-08-10T04:50:09-04:00` as `00e7bb4ab0fcd9013ffa924ce6c5a8ae2c2ae2fc` |
| `historical_planning_base` | `20228c1167814f36d952999f2cafe8b3f6f9ba3c` was the ALR-010 planning-time `origin/main` reference only; do not treat it as current base |
| `current_local_merge_base` | `ed8dbe3bcf3a99fee48f24a5301240fb5282661e`; live Hermes checkout guard blocked an in-session `git merge origin/main`, so PR/review must revalidate or update against then-current `origin/main` before QA Guardian merge |
| `deliverable_branch` | `factory/zeus-alpha-research-ledger-core/inc-010-alr-010-g1-rebaseline-and-local` |
| `deliverable_worktree` | `/home/jean/Projects/.worktrees/zeus-alpha-research-ledger-core/inc-010-alr-010-g1-rebaseline-and-local` |
| `branch_policy` | `factory/zeus-alpha-research-ledger-core/<increment>`; one branch per deliverable |
| `worktree_policy` | one isolated worktree per increment below `/home/jean/Projects/.worktrees/` |
| `propagation` | none in v1; a future Vonash adapter/exchange is a separately approved project/increment |
| `runtime_impact` | local Zeus Agent Core only; never a Vonash deployment |
| `delivery` | signed, labeled GitHub PR → independent QA → QA Guardian merge decision; Zeus never merges/deploys |

## Rationale
The ledger is a local Agent Core module, so it belongs in the Zeus source repository rather than a new service, copied Vonash codebase, or data store. The existing shared Agent Core database is canonical for Zeus modules. The module must use its own schema and runtime role: it may share the database instance but not a broad credential or an external platform’s database.

## Successor and authority boundary

This project succeeds `zeus-independent-alpha-research` by creating the first **private local** research-ledger implementation contract. The predecessor remains the external/Vonash boundary study; it did not create local schema, tools, scheduler or runtime authority.

The v1 ledger stores local research provenance and inert handoffs only. It cannot write to Vonash/Magnus/VAOS/APC/KB/broker runtimes, cannot dispatch network messages, cannot trade, cannot change portfolio/risk state, and cannot mark research as approved strategy, paper/live activation, investment advice or operational instruction.

## PR-first Factory override
Jean explicitly requires source changes to reach QA Guardian through a Zeus-signed PR before any base-branch merge. Therefore every task in this project carries the Factory per-task `increment_integration_waived` metadata with `authorized_by=Jean García` and a recorded PR-first reason. This suppresses Factory’s otherwise automatic branch-to-`main` integration; it does **not** waive review or permit a task to be closed before the actual PR/QA Guardian merge evidence exists.
