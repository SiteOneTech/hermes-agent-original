## 2. Evidence log (real, 2026-08-10)

1. `hermes factory status factory-runtime-evolution-continuation --json` (48,655 B):
   project active; 14 G1 docs blocking; human_questions=[]; gates=[]; anomalies as above.
2. Planning-review reconciliation: independent content review passed in Factory
   planning gate `690` on 2026-08-10. This doc-only follow-up aligns every
   required document with `reviewed:true` markers after prior gate `684` failed on
   missing per-document status rows; no active FRE-010 rework remains.
3. Runtime analysis (baseline commit `20228c116`):
   - `hermes_cli/factory_pg.py:4523` supervisor_health_check; `:4584–4586` pending-question
     → manual_attention bypass; `:3423` bounded requeue; `:3479` mark_project_manual_attention;
     `:2429` close_project (no reopen counterpart); `:247` TERMINAL_PROJECT_STATUSES.
   - `hermes_cli/factory_pg.py:3205` classifier taxonomy; `:3312` question creation with
     `human_question_skipped_unactionable` guard; `:3351` explicit-question requirement.
   - `hermes_cli/factory_contracts.py` closed contracts.
   - `scripts/factory/*` repo-backed cron scripts (L1/L2/watchdog/status/reviewer).
   - Tests: `tests/hermes_cli/test_factory_control_plane_refactor.py:757/788/850`,
     `test_factory_cron_control_plane.py`, `test_factory_orchestrator_tick.py`,
     `test_factory_increment_integration.py`.
4. Predecessor operational evidence: `QA_REPORT.md:227–234` (idle smoke
   classified=0/questions=0/alerts=0), `RETROSPECTIVE_INC_0008.md` (cron ownership),
   `TRACKER.md` (INC-0006..0009), `FACTORY_RUNTIME_EVOLUTION_PLAN.md` (L1/L2/L3),
   git `d3d08dc2e` + `bc7ab6af6`.
5. FRE-025 behavior-first evidence (2026-08-12): selected regression command RED
   `16 failed, 2 passed in 2.23s`; identical selection GREEN
   `18 passed in 0.78s`. Final owner verification (2026-08-13T08:28:52Z):
   focused `scripts/run_tests.sh` suite `161 passed, 0 failed`; `git diff --check`
   exit 0. Details are recorded in `RETROSPECTIVE_FRE_025.md`.

## 3. Gate log

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| G0 Repository Strategy | passed | DB `project_created` event 172950 (repo_scope zeus_only, base main, per_deliverable worktrees) |
| G1 Documentary Readiness | passed | 14 docs exist/indexed/committed/validated:true/reviewed:true after solution-architect review; planning gate 690=passed |
| Review (FRE-010) | passed | solution-architect review, 2026-08-10, planning gate 690 |
| Delivery | not applicable yet | no product-runtime code in G1 |
| FRE-025 owner QA | passed | focused suite `161 passed, 0 failed`; `git diff --check` exit 0; exact commands in `RETROSPECTIVE_FRE_025.md` |
| FRE-025 independent review | pending | must review the exact committed diff |
| FRE-025 source integration | pending | branch must be verified integrated into declared `origin/main`; existing open PRs remain independently gated |

## 4. Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Document/DB review-marker drift after G1 review | Keep per-document `validated:true` and `reviewed:true` rows synchronized with the recorded Factory planning gate evidence before downstream dispatch |
| Detached successor semantics confuse lineage | FRE-014 adds reopen/continue; this project records `continuation_of: factory-runtime-evolution` intent in its docs now |
| Cron resume regressions | FRE-013/017 incremental resume with smoke evidence; idle-silence rule preserved |
| Change-detector tests in new suites | QA_GATES.md bans them; reviewers enforce |
| System actor mislabels a technical block as a human pause | Manual pause requires explicit nonblank authority and origin and rejects reserved actors; canonical technical hold remains supervisable |
| Terminal source increment reconciles before integration | Reconciliation and delivery share a branch-integration guard; successor auto-resume consumes the blocker; only explicit Jean authorization waives it |
| Existing misleading system-attributed user pauses persist | Migrate individually through canonical `technical-hold` after verification; never bulk-edit DB and never downgrade `manual_attention` |
